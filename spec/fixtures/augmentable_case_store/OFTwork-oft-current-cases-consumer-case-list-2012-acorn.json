The\ncontact has been extremely positive and the company has implemented\nrevised terms and conditions, resulting in improvements for consumers.\nAcorn has also improved its sales and after-sales care, and continues to\nwork closely with its local TSS to improve complaints handling. These\nimprovements are being monitored by local TSS.\n\nWe anticipate that this intervention is likely to represent significant\nimprovements for consumers both in relation to purchases and service\nagreements and will consequently also drive up competitive standards\nacross the market.\n\n   \n   \n   \n",

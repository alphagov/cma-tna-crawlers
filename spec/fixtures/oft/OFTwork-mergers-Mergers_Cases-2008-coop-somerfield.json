    "decisions/2009/Co-operative2": "#  Anticipated acquisition by Co-operative Group Limited of Somerfield Limited \n\n**Affected market: **Grocery retailing\n\n**No. **ME/3777/08\n\nThe OFT\\'s decision on reference under section 33(1) was given on 20\nOctober 2008 (the Decision). The full text of the decision was published\non 15 January 2009.\n\n**THE PARTIES**\n\n**Co-operative Group Limited** (CGL) is the UK\\'s largest co-operative\nwith a diverse range of activities including the operation of banks,\nfuneral services, farming, pharmacies and food retailing. This case\ninvolves CGL\\'s food retailing business.\n\nAt the time of making its submission to the OFT, CGL had 2,228 food\nretail stores comprising 1,717 convenience stores, 452 mid size stores\nand 59 one-stop stores.\n\n**Somerfield Limited** (Somerfield) is a food retailer with (at the time\nof making its submission to the OFT) 877 outlets comprising 221\nconvenience stores, 616 mid size stores and 40 one-stop stores.\n\n**TRANSACTION**\n\nIn July 2008 the parties entered into a sale and purchase agreement\nunder which CGL will acquire the entire share capital of Somerfield\\'s\nholding company, Violet Holdings Limited (the Transaction). Completion\nof the Transaction is conditional on the OFT not referring the\nTransaction to the Competition Commission (CC).\n\n**JURISDICTION**\n\nAs a result of this transaction CGL and Somerfield will cease to be\ndistinct. The proposed merger does not have a Community dimension under\nthe EC Merger Regulation [\\[see note 1\\]](#_note-see%20note%201) since\nboth parties achieve more than two thirds of their Community turnover in\nthe UK.\n\nThe UK turnover of Somerfield exceeds £70 million, so the turnover test\nin section 23(1)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act) is satisfied.\n\nThe OFT concluded in its Decision that arrangements were in progress or\nin contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the\ncreation of a relevant merger situation.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nThe Decision concluded that, on the evidence available, it is or may be\nthe case that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial\nlessening of competition within a market or markets in the United\nKingdom. Specifically, the OFT has found that there is a realistic\nprospect of a substantial lessening of competition as a result of the\nproposed merger in the retailing of groceries in 133 local areas.\n\nTo address the OFT\\'s competition concerns CGL offered undertakings to\ndivest a store (or stores) in each of the 133 local areas identified by\nthe OFT, thereby effectively removing the store overlap created by the\nproposed merger and resolving the OFT\\'s competition concerns. In 24\nlocal areas where the OFT was concerned that there were expected to be a\nlimited number of potential purchasers that might be interested in\nbuying the divested store and who did not raise their own competition\nconcerns in the event of a divestment to them, CGL offered to make the\ndisposal of stores in those areas subject to an up-front buyer provision\nin its proposed undertakings.\n\nFollowing suspension of the OFT\\'s duty to refer, CGL entered into sale\nagreements, conditional only upon OFT acceptance of the undertakings in\nlieu and completion of the Transaction, to transfer stores in the 24\nlocal areas that were subject to an up-front buyer provision. The\nproposed purchasers for these stores were named in Annex 1 of the\nproposed undertakings.\n\nIn the case of one up-front buyer store (the Somerfield store in\nVictoria Road, Glasgow) the parties stated that none of the eligible\neffective competitors (as defined in the Decision) [\\[see note\n2\\]](#_note-see%20note%202) was willing to purchase on a stand-alone\nbasis either the Somerfield store or the overlapping CGL store, even for\nnominal consideration. CGL provided a range of evidence in support of\nthis. CGL therefore submitted Lidl, an established supermarket operator,\nas their proposed purchaser for the Somerfield Glasgow Victoria Road\nstore.\n\nThe OFT considered whether it would be appropriate to approve Lidl as a\npurchaser for the Somerfield store in Victoria Road, Glasgow\nnotwithstanding that it was a grocery retailer from outside the\neffective competitor set. The OFT considers that, in the demonstrable\nabsence of any purchaser from within the effective competitor set,\napproving Lidl as a purchaser provides the most satisfactory and\ncomprehensive means of restoring competition to pre-merger levels.\n\nThe OFT\\'s approval of Lidl for Somerfield Glasgow Victoria Road is\nstrengthened by the OFT\\'s belief that, were the merger to be referred\nto the CC the CC would be no better placed than the OFT to identify an\neffective purchaser to resolve competition concerns in this area.\n\n**CONSULTATION**\n\nOn 4 December 2008 the OFT published the proposed undertakings (the\noriginal undertakings) inviting interested parties to give their views\non them by 29 December 2008 pursuant to paragraph 2(1) Schedule 10 of\nthe Act.  \n    \n The OFT received a small number of responses to its consultation. As a\nresult of some of the representations it received, the OFT decided to\nmake two modifications to the original undertakings.\n\nThe first modification was designed to ensure that, where CGL could have\ndivested a freehold interest, but decides, or is requested by the\npurchaser, instead to grant a long lease to the purchaser in question,\nit also sells its residual freehold interest to a third party\nindependent of it. This is designed to ensure that the purchaser of the\nlong lease is independent of and unconnected to CGL and that its\nability, viably and actively, to compete with CGL and other competitors\nin the provision of grocery retailing is not prejudiced by having CGL as\nthe landlord of the site in question.\n\nThe second modification provided additional comfort to the OFT that a\npurchaser has the incentive itself to run the store or stores it\nacquires. CGL has included a provision within all sale and purchase\nagreements that it has already entered into (that is, in respect of all\nof the divestment businesses subject to an up-front buyer provision and\nthose other divestment business for which CGL has already entered into a\nsale and purchase agreement) that includes a warranty that the purchaser\nhas the financial resources, expertise and incentive to run the divested\nstore(s) in competition to CGL.\n\nThe OFT also received representations that it considered did not impact\non the suitability of the purchasers listed for the 24 up-front buyer\nstores in terms of remedying, mitigating or preventing the substantial\nlessening of competition in the relevant local areas. Further, the OFT\ndid not consider that these comments impact on the terms of the\nundertakings in lieu.\n\nOne third party submitted that, in broad terms, the approach the OFT\nintended to adopt for approving purchasers outside the effective\ncompetitor set discriminated against these retailers without\njustification. The OFT should, it said, instead, undertake detailed\nmarket analysis in each local area containing a divestment store before\ndetermining whether to approve a purchaser. The OFT considers that the\ncomments by the third party do not alter the suitability of the\nidentified purchasers for the up-front buyer stores listed in the\noriginal undertakings but rather focused on what the OFT\\'s approach\nshould be for the remaining stores. Therefore, the OFT did not regard\nthe comments as relevant in deciding whether to modify further the\noriginal undertakings or to accept them.\n\nAnother third party commented that the divestment stores should be\ndivested by process of \\'blind bids\\' in order to prevent CGL from\nselecting weaker competitors as purchasers. The OFT does not consider\nthat such an approach is necessary since all proposed purchasers for the\ndivested stores are required under the original undertakings to be\napproved by the OFT before they are permitted to purchase a store to\nensure that they fulfil the purchaser approval criteria in the original\nundertakings (including the requirement to remedy, mitigate or prevent\nthe substantial lessening of competition).\n\nThe OFT\\'s attention was also drawn to the need to bear in mind any\naccretion to national, as well as local, market power when considering\npurchasers\\' suitability for store divestments. The OFT notes that (as\nprovided for in the undertakings) it will approve a purchaser only where\nit is satisfied that the acquisition by that purchaser of the relevant\nstore (or stores) does not create a realistic prospect of a substantial\nlessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK – which\nincludes competition at a national level. Furthermore, the OFT is\nconfident that the ultimate divestment of all the stores will not risk\ncreating any new competition concerns at the national level, as the\ndivestment package represents a very small proportion of the national\ngrocery market and the divestments are expected to be distributed among\nmultiple buyers (as has already been the case for the 24 stores subject\nto an up-front buyer provision).\n\nFor the reasons given above, the OFT does not consider that it should\nfurther modify or refuse to accept the original undertakings on the\nbasis of these representations.\n\nOn 7 January 2009 the OFT published the proposed modified undertakings\n(the modified undertakings) inviting interested parties to give their\nviews on the proposed modifications by 13 January 2009 pursuant to\nparagraph 2(4) Schedule 10 of the Act.\n\nThe OFT received one response on the modified undertakings. A third\nparty submitted that paragraphs 2.6 and 3.6 of the modified undertakings\n(which require CGL to obtain a warranty from a purchaser that the\npurchaser has the financial resources, expertise and incentive to\nmaintain and operate the divested store(s) in competition with CGL)\nplaces no requirement on the purchaser to maintain and operate the store\nand may not be an effective means of ensuring that effective competition\noccurs. The OFT considers that, in the circumstances of this case, it\nwould be disproportionate, in terms of placing obligations on either CGL\nor purchasers of divestment stores, for it to go further than requiring\nthe inclusion of such a warranty. In particular, the OFT notes that all\nthe upfront buyer stores were sold to established grocery retailers, and\nthere is no reason to consider that the sale of the remaining stores\nwould be materially different in this respect. Further, the OFT has not\nconsidered it appropriate in previous grocery divestment cases to\nrequire ongoing obligations in relation to the purchasers of divestment\nstores and it is not aware of any evidence that remedies in previous\ngrocery cases have been ineffective as a result. Moreover, the OFT is\nnot aware of any reason justifying a substantially different approach in\nthis case.\n\nTherefore, the OFT does not consider that the modified undertakings\nrequire further modification.\n\n**DECISION**\n\nThe Decision concluded that the merger would be referred to the CC if\nthe parties failed to give suitable undertakings pursuant to section 73\nof the Act to address the competition concerns identified in the\nDecision.\n\nThe OFT considers that the modified undertakings are clear cut and\nappropriate to remedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of\ncompetition and any adverse effects resulting from it. The OFT has\ntherefore decided to accept the modified undertakings offered by CGL.\n\nThe proposed merger will therefore not be referred to the CC and the\nmodified undertakings, which have been signed by CGL, will come into\neffect from the day CGL completes its acquisition of Somerfield.  \n   \n **NOTES**   \n   \n 1.

The full text of the Decision was published\non 17 November 2008.  \n   \n   \n **THE PARTIES**\n\n1\\. **Co-operative Group Limited (CGL)** is the UK\\'s largest\nco-operative with a diverse range of activities including the operation\nof banks, funeral services, farming, pharmacies and food retailing. This\ncase involves CGL\\'s food retailing business.\n\n2\\. At the time of making its submission to the OFT, CGL had 2,228 food\nretail stores comprising 1,717 convenience stores, 452 mid size stores\nand 59 one-stop stores.\n\n3\\. **Somerfield Limited (Somerfield)** is a food retailer with (at the\ntime of making its submission to the OFT) 877 outlets comprising 221\nconvenience stores, 616 mid size stores and 40 one-stop stores.\n\n**TRANSACTION**\n\n4\\. In July 2008 the parties entered into a sale and purchase agreement\nunder which CGL would acquire the entire share capital of Somerfield\\'s\nholding company, Violet Holdings Limited (the Transaction). Completion\nof the Transaction was conditional on the OFT not referring the\nTransaction to the Competition Commission (CC).\n\n**JURISDICTION**\n\n5\\. As a result of this transaction CGL and Somerfield ceased to be\ndistinct. The UK turnover of Somerfield exceeded £70 million, so the\nturnover test in section 23(1)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)\nwas satisfied.\n\n6\\. The OFT concluded in its Decision that arrangements were in progress\nor in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the\ncreation of a relevant merger situation.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\n7\\. The Decision concluded that, on the evidence available, it is or may\nbe the case that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial\nlessening of competition within a market or markets in the United\nKingdom. Specifically, the OFT found that there was a realistic prospect\nof a substantial lessening of competition as a result of the proposed\nmerger in the retailing of groceries in 133 local areas.\n\n8\\. To remedy the loss of competition in these areas the OFT accepted\nundertakings in lieu from CGL on 15 January 2009, which subsequently\ncame into force when CGL completed its acquisition of Somerfield on 27\nFebruary 2009 (the CGL/Somerfield UILs). Under these undertakings, CGL\nwas required to divest a store (or stores) in each of the 133 local\nareas (as listed in the annexes to the UILs).\n\n9\\. In March 2009 the OFT decided to suspend its duty to refer while it\nconsidered accepting undertakings in lieu of a reference with respect to\nCGL\\'s merger with Lothian Borders &amp; Angus Co-operative Society\nLimited (LBA). [\\[see note 1\\]](#_note-see%20note%201)Today, the OFT has\naccepted these undertakings.\n\n10\\. The OFT considers it appropriate to supersede the CGL/Somerfield\nUILs (pursuant to section 92(2)(b)(ii) of the Act) with new UILs to take\naccount of the fact that LBA is now part of CGL.\n\n11\\. In five of the local areas around a Somerfield store where CGL is\nrequired to make a divestment(s) pursuant to the CGL/Somerfield UILs, an\nLBA store overlapped with the Somerfield store. CGL requested that in\nthese areas it should be allowed the option of divesting either a\nSomerfield store or the former LBA store. The OFT agreed.\n\n**CONSULTATION**\n\n12\\. On 8 April 2009 the OFT published the proposed new UILs inviting\ninterested parties to give their views on them by 23 April 2009 pursuant\nto paragraph 2(1) Schedule 10 of the Act.\n\n13\\. The OFT did not receive any responses to its consultation.\n\n**DECISION**\n\n14\\. In light of CGL\\'s merger with LBA, the OFT considers that the new\nUILs superseding the existing UILs are clear-cut and appropriate to\nremedy, mitigate or prevent the substantial lessening of competition and\nany adverse effects resulting from it identified by the OFT in its\nDecision. The OFT has therefore decided to accept the superseded UILs\noffered by CGL and they come into effect from today.  \n   \n <strong>NOTES<br /> </strong>   \n 1.Completed merger between Co-operative Group Limited and Lothian\nBorders &amp; Angus Co-operative Society Limited, OFT decision of 6\nMarch 2009, Case ME/3933/08.\n\n   \n",
